# Snake

### Description
This was project one of the GA SEI course, completed during week four of the course. The brief was to create a grid-based game using HTML, CSS & JavaScript. Planning involved wireframing the MVP and creating the pseudocode for planning before executing the game build.

### Deployment link

### Timeframe and working team
This was a solo project to be created within one week. This is the first project worked on as part of the GA SEI course.

### Technologies used
* HTML 
* CSS
* JavaScript

### Brief
The brief was to create a grid-based game, Snake. The MVP required the snake having the ability to eat food, grow bigger and speed up as it eats more. The game should end when the snake collides with the wall or itself.


### Planning

### Build/Code Process

### Challenges

### Wins
I struggled to get the caterpillar into the first and last columns and rows without executing the endGame function. I worked around this by using the edge cells as the 'wall'. I did this by adding an 'edge-cell' class to these cells and applying a restructiion on these cells so that the apples or caterpillar could not enter them during the game. I then applied a transparent background to these cells so the 'wall' then appeared to be the egde of the grid as I had planned.
